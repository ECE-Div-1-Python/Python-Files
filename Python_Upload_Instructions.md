# Python Exercise Submission Instructions


## Folder Structure
Each student must create a **folder named using their roll number** in this format:
24BECXXX

**Example:**
24BEC001


Inside your folder, create **12 subfolders** for each exercise:
24BEC001
├── exercise1/
├── exercise2/
├── ...
├── exercise12/

Each subfolder should contain `.py` files for that exercise.


## How to Upload Your Folder (GitHub Web)

1. Go to the [python-files repository]
2. Click on **Add file > Upload files**.
3. Drag and drop your folder (e.g., `24BEC001`) into the upload area.
4. Click **Commit changes**.


## Important Guidelines

- **Do not delete or modify anyone else's folder.**
- Upload only your own code.
- Make sure all file names are appropriate and organized.

Let's keep it clean and organized!
